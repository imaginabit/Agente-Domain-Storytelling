# Contributing to Agente Domain Storytelling

Thanks for your interest in improving this project! Please follow these guidelines to make collaboration smooth and efficient.

## 📋 Before you start

- Search the issues to avoid duplicates. If you have a major change in mind, open an issue first to discuss.
- Fork the repo and create a branch using a descriptive name: `feature/<topic>`, `fix/<issue>`, or `docs/<topic>`.

## 🧭 Branches and commits

- Keep changes small and focused.
- Use meaningful commit messages. A suggested format:
  - `feat: add <short description>`
  - `fix: correct <short description>`
  - `docs: update <doc name>`

## 🧪 Tests & validation

- This repository is primarily documentation in Markdown — ensure readability, consistency, and links.
- If you add scripts or tests, include instructions on how to run them in the PR description.

## 🔁 Pull requests

- Open a PR from your fork with a clear description of the changes and why they help.
- Link the related issue (if any) and provide examples or screenshots where helpful.
- One maintainer review is required before merging.

## 📝 Issue templates

Use the issue templates to file clear, actionable issues.

## 🧾 Code of Conduct

Please follow basic etiquette: be respectful, provide constructive feedback, and focus on the problem, not the person. If you want, I can add a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
