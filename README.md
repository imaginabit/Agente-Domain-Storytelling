## ⚙️ How to use

**Compatibility note:** This repository is intended to be used with **Claude Code** and is compatible with **OpenCode**. For Claude, copy the `agents/` and `skills/` directories into your `~/.claude/` directory so they appear as `~/.claude/agents` and `~/.claude/skills` (e.g., `cp -r agents ~/.claude/` and `cp -r skills ~/.claude/`). OpenCode can also read that location, though it may accept other workspace locations depending on its configuration — check OpenCode settings if needed.

1. Browse the `agents/` and `skills/` folders to find guides and templates.
2. Read each skill’s `SKILL.md` for detailed instructions, examples, and references.
3. To adapt a resource, create a new branch, make your changes, and open a pull request with a clear description.

> Note: This repository is primarily Markdown documentation; no special installation is required to read or edit it.
